# Book Recommender System | Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Developed a comprehensive book recommendation system featuring both popularity-based and collaborative filtering models.

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on three datasets (Books, Users, and Ratings) using Pandas to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

Engineered a collaborative filtering model by constructing a user-item matrix for users with over 200 ratings and books with over 50 ratings.

Utilized Scikit-learn's cosine similarity to calculate likeness scores between books and provide personalized recommendations based on user ratings.

Implemented a popularity-based model to recommend the top 50 books with the highest average ratings, filtered for those with a minimum of 250 ratings.

Serialized the final models and dataframes using Pickle for potential deployment in a web application.
